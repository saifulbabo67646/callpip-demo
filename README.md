# AI-Powered Voice IVR System: Revolutionizing Customer Service

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Traditional IVR (Interactive Voice Response) systems are often frustrating for users due to their rigid menu structures, limited understanding of natural language, and inability to handle complex queries effectively. This leads to poor customer experience, longer resolution times, and increased operational costs for businesses.

## 💡 Our Solution
We've developed an innovative AI-powered Voice Agent that transforms traditional IVR systems into intelligent, conversational interfaces. Our solution combines state-of-the-art voice AI technology with existing telephony infrastructure to create a seamless, natural, and efficient customer service experience.

## 🌟 Key Features
- **Natural Language Understanding**: Users can speak naturally without following rigid menu structures
- **Context-Aware Conversations**: AI remembers conversation context for more meaningful interactions
- **Real-Time Learning**: System continuously improves from each interaction
- **Seamless Integration**: Works with existing telephony infrastructure
- **Multi-lingual Support**: Handles multiple languages for diverse user bases
- **Smart Routing**: Intelligent call routing based on query complexity and agent expertise
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Real-time insights into customer interactions and system performance

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
### Communication Infrastructure
- **WebRTC**: Real-time voice communication with low latency
- **Twilio SIP Trunking**: Enterprise-grade telephony integration
- **LiveKit**: Real-time communication platform for voice and video

### AI & Voice Processing
- **Speech Recognition**: speech-to-text models
- **Text-to-Speech**: text-to-speech models for natural voice synthesis
- **Language Models**: LLM models for natural language understanding
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: For context-aware responses using LlamaIndex
- **Maira**: Using Maira instead of Language models and rag system to get personalized responses and fullfilling the LLM and RAG needs.

### Backend Technologies
