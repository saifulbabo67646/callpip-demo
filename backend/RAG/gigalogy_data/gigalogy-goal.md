## Our Mission

Our DNA is reflected in our name: Gigalogy is a contraction of 
Giga and Analogy. Giga represents a huge number, and analogy; 
a comparison between one thing to another for explanation. In 
the world of Artificial Intelligence, there could be billions of 
patterns that we can not imagine with our mind. Our mission is 
to make sure these unknown patterns can be transformed into 
something easy to understand and meaningful for everyone.

| We are aiming a cultural transition from gut driven, historical precedent based organization to data driven and/or data informed organization for our customers. | AI solutions that are able to deliver products and services that are useful, better than the alternatives, are enjoyable and delightful, and result in good experience. |
